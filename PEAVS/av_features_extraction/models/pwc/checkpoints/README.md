PWC-Net pre-trained model (`pwc_net_sintel.pt`) was taken from `https://github.com/sniklaus/pytorch-pwc`. We also provide the old version of the model which was used in [MDVC](https://github.com/v-iashin/MDVC) project (`network-default.pytorch`). If you are not sure which to use, please use `pwc_net_sintel.pt`.
